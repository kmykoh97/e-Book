# E-Book

A reactive mini Electronic Bookstore e-book project frontend

## Survey

To further investigate the usefulness of this idea, we have randomly selected 15 students from Shanghai Jiao Tong University to give their opinions. Below are breakdown of some important points which may spark some interest:

### Table of survey result

| Attributes | No Of Respondents Agree | no Of Respondents Disagree | no Of Respondents Maybe | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Usefulness | 12 | 0 | 3 | Useful |
| Feasibility | 15 | 0 | 0 | Feasible |
| Similarity with existing application | 7 | 3 | 5 | Might be similar |
| Ability to compete | 10 | 0 | 5 | Able to compete |
| Technical difficulties | 6 | 6 | 3 | Might not be difficult |
| User experience | 12 | 3 | 0 | Will improve lifestyle |
| Interest in our product | 15 | 0 | 0 | Very interested |
| Would you use it? | 5 | 5 | 5 | Will try to use |

### Conclusion  

This idea is doable and most probably able to spark some interest among our users especially students in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Althought our survey sample size is small and not really targeted evenly among users in all backgrounds but the result seems promising. After we have consulted our tutor in charge, Ren Rui from School Of Software, SJTU, we can conclude that this is indeed a promising idea and hopefully we might be able to bring more people together in a world of reading.

## Feature Request

Due to time constraint and lack of required skillsets among our us, we only manage to produce front-end of this web application.

However, feel free to open an issue to ask for a new feature support.
